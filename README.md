# learned_machine
this repo will contain stuff i come up with while figuring out a way to create a big data/machine learning trading prediction tool
For now, the general outlines are these:
1) Decide on the source of data
2) Figure out ways to import data (Flume, Hive, something else)
3) Place data into HDFS (probably)
4) Run machine-learning magic on it
5) Come up with predictions
6) Test predictions against reality (probably)
7) Visualise stuff (maybe)

Things I'll probably use are Sparkling Water and other nice thing from the Hadoop stack.

Also, have to figure out the whole trading side of this thing.
